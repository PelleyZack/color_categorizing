# color_categorizing
 Project with goal of creating a program that counts the total color used in a picture and visually processes that data

Started out by following a python project tutorial at
URL:https://data-flair.training/blogs/project-in-python-colour-detection/
The initial point was to output the color at the point the user double clicks

After getting the code to work I thought of how I could branch off from this project to work with it more.
I decided the best way was to augment it so that on command the program looks at each pixel in the picture and counts how many time each color in the csv appears

Will expand this program to work with matlab in order to visulize the data
